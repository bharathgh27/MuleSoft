->First i created local database and created table in it.
-> Then i inserted values to table and tried retrieving database values manually.

->Once i able to perform the CRUD manually in local database then 
i started developing the Java Code to perform CRUD using JDBC to connect MySql and Java, and seen output in localhost:8080 by default port value of localhost is 8080 .

->After completing CRUD through Java and MySql using JDBC i started to develop REST API using SpringBoot and Postman.
	->First i created maven project in start.spring.io and downloaded zip file
	->then i extracted it and import project files to workspace
	->I started editing pom.xml as i required to run the project mainly focused an dependencies,plugin
	-> After pom.xml is completed i created package and in project i used package name com.practice.demo
	->inside package i created DemoApplication.java to run SpringBoot
	-> and inside created separate packages for controller,DBA,Services
	-> In Controller package i created Employee.java and EmployeeController.java where we perform insert and retrieve of data(also update and delete) from database through Java,MySql,SpringBoot and Postman
	-> In DBA package i created DatabaseConnectionManager.java where i made operation to connect database and perform operation to database
	-> In Services package i created EmployeeManager.java, it gives connection to dba for controller to perform operation when it is called
->After all the steps done run the DemoApplication.java and we can perform inserting to table and retrieving from table through Postman using GET and POST.
